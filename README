= Multi Site

Created by Sean Cribbs, November 2007. Inspired by the original virtual_domain
behavior.

Multi Site allows you to host multiple websites on a single Radiant
installation. 

This is an extended version that also gives you a flexible
way to scope other model classes to the current site. To scope a model defined 
in another extension, give it a side_id column and do this:

  class Something < ActiveRecord::Base
    is_site_scoped
    ...
  end

These additions are all very alpha at the moment, but properly specced.
There is also some slightly provisional code in there at the moment to extend 
validate_uniquess_of so that site scope is automatically added. It has to 
take effect at an early stage of initialisation so it relies on the presence 
of a site_id column rather than the is_site_scoped call. Like I say, 
provisional. It may be that is_site_scoped should kick in automatically for 
any already loaded classes that have a site_id column.

To scope the admin interface so that layouts and snippets are separate for
each site (as well as pages) and only admin users can switch between sites,
you need the scoped_admin extension as well. It'll be up on github shortly.

Meanwhile, in the original multi_site, each site has its own independent 
sitemap/page-tree and these attributes:

  name: Whatever you want to call the site
  domain: A Ruby regular expression (without the //) to match the request
          against
  base_domain: A canonical domain name for doing quicker matches and for
               generating absolute URLs against
  homepage_id: The numerical database ID of the root page (usually
               you can just leave this alone).

== Installation

1) Unpack/checkout/export the extension into vendor/extensions of your 
   project.

2) Run the extension migrations.

  $ rake production db:migrate:extensions

3) Run the extension update task.

  $ rake production radiant:extensions:multi_site:update

4) Restart your server

== Other Extensions

Multi Site allows you to customize routes within your other extensions. To
restrict a route to a particular site, pass the site's name into the
conditions hash:

   map.resources :things, :conditions => { :site => 'My Site' }

You can also scope a route to multiple sites with an array:

   map.resources :things, :conditions => { :site => ['My Site', 'Your Site'] }
